👩🏻‍💻 <p align="center"><strong>About me</strong></p>
👩🏻‍💻  Chemical engineer with a master's degree in environmental engineering, my focus lies predominantly in data analysis. I'm deeply passionate about delving into the dynamics behind phenomena, pinpointing influential factors, and proposing predictive solutions. Always eager to learn and stay updated, I'm currently enrolled in a technology bootcamp at TripleTen. During this program, I implemented a simulation model in Python to forecast game success, leveraging historical sales data, user ratings, market trends, and game features. I managed data and implemented databases to identify potentially successful games across different regions using Python and SQL, and crafted reports and dashboards with game profit analysis by region using Tableau. At Grand Hanny’s, I analyzed sales from 2019 to 2024 using DAX to ascertain trends and growth patterns within the company, identifying top-selling products and key sales points. Additionally, I developed dashboards integrating revenue, expenses, KPIs, and sales analysis using Power BI.

📈 My focus is on delivering tangible results through data analysis, leveraging my expertise in Tableau and Power BI for visualization and analysis, thereby assisting companies in making informed, strategic decisions.

🎯 My goals include continuously enhancing my data analysis skills and expanding my knowledge of advanced tools and techniques in the field. I aspire to make meaningful contributions to projects that drive innovation and efficiency within companies, utilizing data analysis to provide strategic, high-impact solutions. Committed to ongoing professional development, I aim to reach new levels of excellence in my career as a Data Analyst.
